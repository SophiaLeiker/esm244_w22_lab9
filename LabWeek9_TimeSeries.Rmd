# Part 1: Time series wrangling & forecasting

To reinforce skills for wrangling, visualizing, and forecasting with time series data, we will use data on US residential energy consumption from January 1973 - October 2017 (from the US Energy Information Administration). 

- Dataset: U.S. Residential Energy Consumption (Jan 1973 - Oct 2017)
- Units: Trillion BTU
- Source: US Energy Information Administration (data.gov)

Read in data and convert to a time series 
```{r}
energy <- read_csv(here("data", "energy.csv"))
```
